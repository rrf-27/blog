                <p>As I mentioned before, I'm a romanian teenager learning in Bucharest and since march 2020, I've been learning from home mostly. I've been at school just for four weeks, so, I want to show you how I spent my time and what I learnt during this time.

                    Well, at the beginning, for me, it was like a dream came true, because the pandemic closed schools. I had no idea what is going to be, so I was relaxed. I had a lot of free time and I didn't realize that I had an exam and I had to learn more for it, so nothing was better than a Netflix movie. I spent my time watching a lot of movies and doing nothing else. I stopped talking to any friend. I barely left home and I barely realized that the clock was ticking.  That's how the pandemic started for me and writing these lines, I realize for the first time that I spent more time than I could ever imagine, doing nothing.

            <div class="paragraf">
                After three and a half months, the exam came and I had to do my best there. "I have to be better than anyone because I don't want to disappoint my parents", that's what I told myself. When I finished, I was convinced that I did my best, but when the day of the results came, I realized that I was wrong, so I disappointed myself more than anyone else. I was looking around and I didn't know  who is guilty for this, because I didn't want to think that I was guilty, so I blame the pandemic. I thought that my failure had happened just because of it. I thought that that was the reason I didn't learn as I should.  At that moment, I wanted to believe these things, so I put them in my comfort zone. I think the reason I did this is that I was lazy and I want you to know that blaming someone else for something that is your fault is not about making your life easier, it's about becoming a lazy person who will never progress as long as that person stays in her comfort zone.

                    During the summer, everything got better, because the holiday started and I was aware that I had a lot of free time that I should spend carefully. At the end of the summer, I left Romania for few days and I spent my time in Greece. I saw there a lot people who came from my country and I felt like I was back there, in Romania, but with a major difference: the people from there were more polite. I can't say that people from my country are not being educated, but as everywhere here are some exceptions and also, I think that here are more exceptions than it should be.

                    Finally when the holiday ended, the school started again. At the beginning it was weird because, half of my classmates was staying home while the other half was going to school. I have to say that when I got to school and I met my classmates for the first time, I wasn't able to talk. This made me feel NOT OK. Then, I realized that I wasn't able to talk just because I hadn't been speaking to someone since the school ended. Also, I realized that because of this I was having no friends. So, you should never stop talking to your friends because it's more comfortable like that and you should never think that you can live without any friend, because you would be wrong and you will regret this when you will realize what a big mistake you did.
